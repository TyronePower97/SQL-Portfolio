-- First I intended to lay out the chart to get a full view of what I would be working with
SELECT *
FROM superstore;
-- Here I am organizing the Data by showing the items within the table with a descending price range
SELECT item_name, price 
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price desc;
-- Here I use the "SUM" function to determine the total units the superstore has in stock
SELECT SUM(stock_quantity) AS total_units
FROM superstore;
-- Here I isolate the "Kitchen Supplies" and use the function "WHERE" to determine the average price 
SELECT AVG(price) AS Kitchen_supply_average
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Kitchen Supplies";

-- If I needed to determine how many total security cameras were left in stock, here is how I would do it
SELECT SUM(stock_quantity) AS Total_Security_Cameras
FROM superstore
WHERE item_name="Smart Home Security Camera";
