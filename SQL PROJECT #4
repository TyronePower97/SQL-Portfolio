My goal for this project was to view the given dataset as a dataset given to me by my boss that was trying to determine a number of things to help with revenue increase. I wanted to figure out three major questions that would help increase overall listenability to 
the playlists used in the dataset, as well as increasing the bottom line.
The first question I wanted to determine was; 
1) Which year had the highest overall revenue among the three years available in the dataset.
-- To do this I wanted to run three simple queries to determine the total net profit of each year
SELECT sum(Total) as Total
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
;
- The total for this query was 449.46.
I ran the same query two more times only adjust the date on line 8 from '2009%' to '2010%' and then to '2011%'
The values for 2010 and 2011 were 481.45 and 469.58
-So from here I determined that the most lucrative year for the company was 2010, so I wanted to figure what key factors were at play that led to this.
-I decided to lay out which artists were most prevalent that year, which playlists had the most streams, and which customers were the most active.
