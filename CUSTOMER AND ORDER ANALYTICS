For this Project my goal was to take on a larger data set and deal with revenue calculations and product management. 

# With larger data sets like this one, I wanted to make a point of making sure there were no repeated values, where the sales were most popular, that I was able to be aware of certain sales in certain locations, and what products were responsible for the larger chunks of revenue.

For this first query, I wanted to determine how many unique orders were made in January to determine


SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID)>2 


SELECT SUM(quantity) as quantity, product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product like '%Headphone%'
group by product

SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(cust.acctnum) as 'Average spending'
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

SELECT sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

SELECT product, sum(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) desc
LIMIT 1;
